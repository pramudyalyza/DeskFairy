2 LSTM Cells and Their Variants
In RNNs, the recurrent layers or hidden layers consist of recurrent cells
whose states are affected by both past states and current input with feed-
back connections. The recurrent layers can be organized in various archi-
tecturestoformdifferentRNNs.Therefore,RNNsaremainlydistinguished

2.1 Standard Recurrent Cell.Usually RNNs are networks that consist
ofstandardrecurrentcellssuchassigmacellsandtanhcells.Figure1shows
a schematic of the standard recurrent sigma cell. The mathematical expres-
sions of the standard recurrent sigma cell are written as follows:
ht = σ(Whht−1 + Wxxt + b),
yt = ht, (2.1)
wherext,ht,and yt denotetheinput,therecurrentinformation,andtheout-
putofthecellattime t,respectively; Wh andWx aretheweights;and bisthe

(Karpathy, Johnson, & Li, 2015; Li, Li, Cook, Zhu, & Gao, 2018). However,
the recurrent networks that consist of standard recurrent cells are not ca-
pable of handling long-term dependencies: as the gap between the related
inputs grows, it is difficult to learn the connection information. Hochreiter
(1991) and Bengio, Simard, and Frasconi (1994) analyzed fundamental rea-
sons for the long-term dependencies problem: error signals flowing back-
ward in time tend to either blow up or vanish.
2.2 LSTM. In order to deal with the problem of “long-term depen-
dencies,” Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997) proposed the LSTM cell.

akram2017.pdf,"Breast cancer remains a worldwide public health dilemma and is currently the most common tumour in the globe. 
Awareness of breast cancer, public attentiveness, and advancement in breast imaging has made a positive impact 
on recognition and screening of breast cancer. Breast cancer is life-threatening disease in females and the leading 
cause of mortality among women population. For the previous two decades, studies related to the breast cancer 
has guided to astonishing advancement in our understanding of the breast cancer, resulting in further proficient 
treatments. Amongst all the malignant diseases, breast cancer is considered as one of the leading cause of death in 
post menopausal women accounting for 23% of all cancer deaths. It is a global issue now, but still it is diagnosed in 
their advanced stages due to the negligence of women regarding the self inspection and clinical examination of the 
breast. This review addresses anatomy of the breast, risk factors, epidemiology of breast cancer, pathogenesis of breast 
cancer, stages of breast cancer, diagnostic investigations and treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, targeted 
therapies, hormone replacement therapy, radiation therapy, complementary therapies, gene therapy and stem-cell 
therapy etc for breast cancer.",1,Breast Cancer Research
ieee.pdf,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has become the main treatment option for breast cancer.
Its adverse drug reactions (ADRs) make NAC painful both physiologically and psychologically. The factor
pathological complete remission (pCR) describes how well a series of six or more chemotherapeutic treat-
ments works on a patient. This study investigated the possibility of predicting pCR using only the nodal sizes
of the ﬁrst three treatments. A best feature combination for each breast cancer subtype was screened from the
real nodal sizes of the ﬁrst three treatments and the nodal sizes‘ of the next three treatments predicted from
those of the ﬁrst three ones. The prediction was evaluated by the metrics Avc =(sensitivity+speciﬁcity)/2.
A triple-negative breast cancer (TN) patient may have an estimation of pCR Avc =0.8696 after taking just
three treatments. At least Avc =0.7594 was achieved for all the four breast cancer subtypes investigated in
this study.
